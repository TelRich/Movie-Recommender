## Overview
A movie recommender system is a software or algorithm that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. It utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to make personalized movie recommendations.

## Setup
- Make sure you have Python 3.7 or above installed.
- Install the required libraries by running the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Limitation
- Due to the low memory space for free version of streamlit, the data was chunk to 1000. This means the recommender system is limited to the number of movies it can return.
